# TASK-039 — Final Review

## Dependency
TASK-038

## Objective
Perform a whole-platform diff/architecture/security/performance review and resolve verified blockers.

## Mandatory execution
1. Inspect the current repository implementation relevant to this task.
2. Reuse/extend existing code; do not create duplicate Telegram clients, sessions, lifecycle managers, or competing storage systems.
3. Implement the smallest coherent production-quality change set satisfying the objective.
4. Add/update deterministic tests for changed behavior.
5. Run relevant tests and builds.
6. Review concurrency, lifecycle, errors, privacy, compatibility, and resource bounds.
7. Commit only validated work and record evidence.

## Validation gate
- Relevant tests PASS with exact command/results recorded.
- Relevant build PASS with exact command/results recorded.
- No regression to Telegram auth/single-client lifecycle.
- No sensitive/session/private data added to discovery sync/logging.
- Changed files and behavioral impact documented.
