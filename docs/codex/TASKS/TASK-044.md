# TASK-044 — Search Intelligence v4

## Dependency
TASK-043

## Objective
Add query analysis, zero-result recovery, smarter suggestions, and deterministic adaptive ranking inputs.

## Mandatory execution
1. Inspect the current repository implementation relevant to this task.
2. Reuse/extend existing code; do not create duplicate Telegram clients, sessions, lifecycle managers, or competing storage systems.
3. Implement the smallest coherent production-quality change set satisfying the objective.
4. Add/update deterministic tests for changed behavior.
5. Run relevant tests and builds.
6. Review concurrency, lifecycle, errors, privacy, compatibility, and resource bounds.
7. Commit only validated work and record evidence.

## Validation gate
- Relevant tests PASS with exact command/results recorded.
- Relevant build PASS with exact command/results recorded.
- No regression to Telegram auth/single-client lifecycle.
- No sensitive/session/private data added to discovery sync/logging.
- Changed files and behavioral impact documented.

## Suggested commit
